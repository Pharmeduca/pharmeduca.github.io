            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">Hello aspirants! I, Vishal Christian, am sharing my journey with PEBC (still going on) and pharma industry in Canada.To start with, I was a registered pharmacist back home in India and was working as a clinical pharmacist in a government hospital for more than 7 years. I had no exposure of pharma industry in India.I begun my journey with PEBC in order to get my credentials evaluated for bachelor's, then I came to know that Pharmacy degree is considered as a professional degree and gives you points in PR pathways equivalent to Master's. That's perfect start. </p>
            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">Once I got my degree evaluated, based on which I got my PR as well. The second step with PEBC involves exams and having left studies for more than 9 years it was hard to jump right into the study mode. Having experience in being pharmacist only, the obvious first choice for me was to crack the exams and becoming registered pharmacist in Canada. At that time it seemed only hope I had to succeed in Canada. While waiting for my PR file to be cleared, I started preparing for the first evaluating exam in India only. No such platform was available back then to connect with people with similar journey and study appetite. I found few people only and everyone was facing the same scenario. Another factor was pandemic of course.</p>
            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">I appeared in my first exam in January 2022 remotely from home and it was terrible experience. First the timing of the exam was midnight and no other slot was available and there were some technical glitches. My exam was on 12th of January and my flight to canada was on 18th of January. So, in middle of many other things, I gave the exam and I couldn't clear it. It was devastating but had to move on. I took a break from studies for a month or so as I was settling in Canada. I was so much occupied with a thought of cracking exams was the only hope left for me that I felt succumbed at times. With the help of a few friends and connections, I got my first pharmacy assistant job and I decided to continue study along with the job as financial independence is important to feel settled in Canada. </p>
            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">I was studying and having job at the same time and was exhausting. I couldn't able to concentrate as much as this exam needs. Although I was sure in clearing the exam this time around, the june 2022 exam result was again not in my favor. That was the time I started realizing that I had to look for other options if not a pharmacist.</p>
            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">At first, I was scared having no experience in pharma industry and looking for jobs in the sector. With the help of friends whom I could connect and could give references, I started applying for jobs through different platforms available out there. In early attempts, I was getting either no responses or stating that there I did not have experience. However, I kept on trying and fortunately, I end up in Pharma industry. Having decent salary (although a starting pay), I am feeling settled in Canada.</p>
            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">Although it's early days but I came across many people in Pharma Industry who are making better life for themselves. Now, I could able to start thinking about continuing my journey with PEBC as well. But, I know the fact that although it is the best option out there to becoming a registered pharmacist in Canada , it is not the only option available. Eventually, everything will fall into place. </p>
            <p style="color: white;" align="justify">There is nothing out there which stops you to succeed. So, you have to keep on going. Here, in this platform we will try to connect you with right people and provide you space and guidance to decide the best for yourself in pursuing your Canadian dream! I welcome all of you to join our platform and share your journey with us!!Best of luck!</p>
