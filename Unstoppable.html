            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;" align="justify">Hello aspirants! My name is Vishal Christian and I am sharing my journey with PEBC (still going on) and my entry into the pharmaceutical industry in Canada. To start with, I was a registered pharmacist back home in India and was working as a clinical pharmacist in a government hospital for more than 7 years. I had no exposure of pharma industry in India.I begun my journey with PEBC in order to get my credentials evaluated for bachelor's, then I came to know that Pharmacy degree is considered as a professional degree and gives you points in PR pathways equivalent to Master's. That was a perfect start. Once I got my degree evaluated, I was able to file my PR based on that plus my hospital work experience.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold" align="justify">The second step with PEBC involved preparing for the Evaluating exam and boy was it difficult! left studies for more than 9 years it was hard to jump right into the study mode. Having experience in being pharmacist only, the obvious first choice for me was to crack the exams and becoming registered pharmacist in Canada. At that time, it seemed only hope I had to succeed in Canada. While waiting for my PR file to be cleared, I started preparing for the first exam in India itself. No such platform was available back then to connect with people with similar journey and study appetite. I found few people after having to network a lot. On speaking with them, I realized everyone was facing the same scenario.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold" align="justify">I appeared in my first exam in January 2022 remotely from home and it was a terrible experience. First of all, the timing of the exam was in midnight and no other slot was available. There were lots of technical glitches during the exam which further reduced my confidence. My exam was on 12th of January and my flight to Canada was on 18th of January. I did not take the best decision by scheduling my exam in the middle of many other things and I was not able to clear the exam. It was a devastating experience but I had to move on.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold" align="justify">I took a break from studies for a month or so as I was settling in Canada. I was so much occupied with a thought of cracking exams was the only hope left for me that I felt succumbed at times. With the help of a few friends and connections, I got my first pharmacy assistant job and I decided to continue study along with a full-time job. By this time, I had come to the realization that financial independence is extremely important to feel settled in Canada. I was studying, doing household chores and working full-time at the same time and that was exhausting to the core. I was not able to give in the time and energy as much as this exam demands. Although I was sure of clearing the exam this time around, the June 2022 EE result was again not in my favour.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold" align="justify">That was the time I started realizing that I had to look for other options if not a pharmacist. At first, I was scared having no experience in pharma industry and looking for jobs in the sector. With the help of friends whom I could connect and could give references, I started applying for jobs through different platforms available out there. In early attempts, I was getting either no responses or stating that there I did not have experience. However, I kept on trying and fortunately, I end up in Pharma industry. Having decent salary (although a starting pay), I can confidently say that I am feeling settled in Canada. Although it is just the early days, I have made some good networks and have across many people in Pharma Industry who are making better life for themselves.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold" align="justify">Although it's early days but I came across many people in Pharma Industry who are making better life for themselves. Now, I could able to start thinking about continuing my journey with PEBC as well. But, I know the fact that although it is the best option out there to becoming a registered pharmacist in Canada , it is not the only option available. Eventually, everything will fall into place. </p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold" align="justify">Now, I could start thinking of continuing my journey with PEBC as well. But now I have come although it is the best option out there to becoming a registered pharmacist in Canada, it is not the only option available. Eventually, everything does fall into place. There is nothing out there which can stop you from succeeding. Believing in yourself is the key and you have to keep on going.
