            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;" align="justify">I feel extremely emotional  as I pen down my story of PEBC jouney till now. My decision to attempt the PEBC exams while on an international student status was a brave one but not less ambitious per say. The life of international students in Canada is no less than a nightmare for we must manage our expenses along with tuition fees and PEBC preparation along with school and a job to support finances. Although the ride has been mentally and physically exhausting but is definitely not impossible.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;" align="justify">The first few months in Canada in did not treat me well as my left totally went out of balance and I found myself  constantly breaking down and second-guessing all my decisions. It took me more than five months before I actually started a job as Pharmacy Assistant in Canada after volunteering at a pharmacy for 1 month, 200+ online application rejections and 79 failed attempts of dropping off resumes at pharmacies. The path ahead of me looked unclear and I felt directionless to the point that i decided to give up on the exams and change my profession.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;" align="justify">However it was my family, seniors and some well-wishing contacts that I made through the community channels who lifted me up during my weakest moments. The experiences they shared and confidence they had in me kept going and trying harder.I decided to put in all of my blood and sweat and 100% attention to my Evaluating exam. I left no stone unturned in preparation and I was able to pass the exam with flying colors. This small victory boosted me  too much and I felt a new sense of confidence within growing within me. Since then there has been no looking back as my attitude towards approaching hardships in life completely changed.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;" align="justify">My MCQ results was no less than a dream for I still feel a sense of accomplishment to the core. I felt as if i could achieve anything in life with my discipline and sincerity and there exists no force which could stop me from being a better version of myself in all aspects. This energy did not crawl into my system overnight for it built within me block-by-block and I must say what a feeling this is! The journey of PEBC is not just about the passing the exams rather living and growing through the passage of life. Growing into an impeccable and tougher version of yourself.</p>
            <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;" align="justify">All your sacrifices and sleepless nights will make sense one day and I promise it will be absolutely worth it! Everyone should go through beautiful journey which teaches you patience, utilizing your fullest potential and taking that leap of faith!</p>
